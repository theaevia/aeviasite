# The Aevia Landing Page Design Prompt

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for creating a high-converting one-page landing site for The Aevia, a doctor-led luxury aesthetics and coaching clinic. The design should be implemented using either Framer or Carrd, with a focus on driving consultation bookings for both the Skin and Mind service offerings.

## Brand Positioning

The Aevia should be positioned as an exclusive, doctor-led clinic offering two complementary pathways to transformation:

1. **Aevia Skin**: Regenerative skin treatments that enhance natural beauty without fillers (polynucleotides, skin boosters, PRP, Botox)
2. **Aevia Mind**: High-agency performance and transformative coaching for professionals

The positioning should emphasize the medical expertise of the doctors (Dr. Terrell, Dr. Renee, and Dr. Manu) while maintaining a luxury aesthetic that appeals to affluent 30-55 year old clients.

## Visual Design Direction

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep navy or midnight blue (conveying trust, expertise, and luxury)
- **Secondary**: Warm gold accents (signaling premium positioning)
- **Tertiary**: Clean whites and soft neutrals (creating space and elegance)

### Typography
- **Headings**: Serif font with distinctive character (e.g., Freight Display, Canela, or Ogg)
- **Body**: Clean sans-serif with excellent readability (e.g., Neue Haas Grotesk, Proxima Nova)
- **Accent**: Light use of a distinctive script font for select quotes or testimonials

### Visual Elements

4. Test all CTAs on both desktop and mobile before launch
5. Consider A/B testing different hero messages if the platform allows
